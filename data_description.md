Input values: 
CF_0: the initial values of Community Functioning 
IR:      Resources for Recovery(new input for the model, just like SC,CF,etc)
PR:     Prevention and Mitigation
PVID:  Population Vulnerability, Inequality, and Deprivation
SC:      Social Capital and Cohesion
genericPM: Prevention and Mitigation under uniform event
hurricanePM: Prevention and Mitigation under hurricane (include the measures of distance to the nearest coast). 



Output values:
1. For uniform event:
genericabs_Resilience: absolute Resilience under uniform event. 
genericrel_Resilience ：relative Resilience(abs_resilience/ CF_0) under uniform event.
genericResistance      ：resistance under uniform event.
genericRecovery         :  recovery under uniform event.

2. For hurricane event:
hurricaneabs_Resilience: absolute Resilience under hurricane event. 
hurricanerel_Resilience ：relative Resilience(abs_resilience/ CF_0) under hurricane event.
hurricaneResistance      ：resistance under hurricane event.
hurricaneRecovery         :  recovery under hurricane event.
